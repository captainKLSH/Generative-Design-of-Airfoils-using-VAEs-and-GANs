# Generative-Design-of-Airfoils-using-VAEs-and-GANs

In this project, we are teaching a computer to "invent" new shapes for airplane wings (airfoils).

1. VAE (The Smooth Painter): This AI looks at thousands of real wings and learns the "average" concept of what a wing looks like. It tends to produce safe, smooth, and continuous shapes, but they can sometimes look a bit blurry or generic.

2. GAN (The Master Forger): This AI uses two brains fighting against each other. One (the Forger) tries to draw a fake wing, and the other (the Detective) tries to guess if it's real or fake. This competition forces the Forger to get really good, resulting in sharp, diverse, and realistic shapes.

## 🚀 Project Description

The objective of this project is to synthesize 2D airfoil geometries using deep generative models. We implement and compare two architectures:

1. Variational Autoencoder (VAE): Encodes airfoils into a latent probability distribution and reconstructs them, focusing on maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO).

2. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN): Utilizes a Generator-Discriminator architecture to synthesize airfoils that match the data distribution through adversarial traini2ng.

Key Tasks:

- Data Processing: Loading coordinate data for airfoil shapes and normalizing them for neural network input.

- Model Implementation: Defining the specific layers (Linear/Convolutional) for both VAE and GAN architectures in PyTorch.

- Training: Implementing the distinct training loops (Reconstruction + KL loss for VAE; Min-Max adversarial loss for GAN).

- Evaluation: Comparing the generated outputs based on visual smoothness, diversity, and training stability.

## 📊 Results & Comparison

Based on the training results and visual inspection documented in the notebook:

1. Visual Quality

- VAE Results: The airfoils generated by the VAE appear more smooth and continuous. They tend to resemble the "average" of the input distribution closely, ensuring valid shapes but potentially lacking variety.

- GAN Results: The GAN-generated airfoils exhibit more diversity and variability. However, they may occasionally lack the perfect smoothness of VAEs or show slight artifacts (jaggedness) typical of adversarial generation.

2. Training Stability

- VAE: The loss function shows some fluctuations, suggesting challenges in convergence or balancing the reconstruction vs. KL-divergence terms.

- GAN: The GAN shows relatively stable Discriminator and Generator losses, indicating that the adversarial game reached an equilibrium where the generator captured the data distribution well.
